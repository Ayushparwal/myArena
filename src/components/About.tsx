  title='Education Journey.'
  content="My passion for math naturally led me into the world of coding, where every challenge feels like a puzzle waiting to be solved. After scoring in the 97th percentile in JEE Mains, I began my journey in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur. I find joy in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Outside academics, Iâ€™m curious about the stock market, enjoy a good game of chess, vibe to Bruno Mars, and never miss a chance to play or watch cricket."
